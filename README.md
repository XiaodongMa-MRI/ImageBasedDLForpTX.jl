This repo contains the Julia scripts for end-to-end image mapping from 1TX to pTX using deep learning.
Specifically, a CNN is used as the neural network (e.g., Unet), with 1TX image as the input and pTX image as the output.

You can run the program by running the julia scripts in the folder src/.
