A deep learning framework for predicting pTx images from sTx images, using diffusion MRI as an specific implementation example.

More details on the method and its utility for diffusion can be found in the paper: X. Ma, K. UÄŸurbil, and X. Wu, Mitigating transmit-B1 artifacts by predicting parallel transmission images with deep learning: a feasibility study using high-resolution whole-brain diffusion at 7 Tesla. submitted to MRM (minor revision)

The code is made publicly available at https://github.com/XiaodongMa-MRI/ImageBasedDLForpTX.jl/releases
